# git-secure-export

Tooling for encrypting `git-fast-export(1)` output.

## Description

This repository provides `git-secure-export`, a postprocessor for
`git-fast-export(1)` which encrypts file and commit message data of
exported git repositories. Additionally, `git-secure-import` is provided
which acts as a preprocessor for `git-fast-import(1)` and allows
importing a previously encrypted `git-fast-export(1)` output.

Based on these two programs, two hacky shell scripts were written which
implement an ssh-based git remote helper (refer to
`gitremote-helpers(7)`) for encrypting repository on the remote. The
setup requires access to the remote server for installing a custom
script and thus does not work with GitHub or other hosted Git solutions.

## Status

Proof of concept, largely untested and likely very buggy.

## Security

The code uses [secretbox][secretbox doc] for symmetric encryption and
authentication of file contents and commit messages. The symmetric key
is stored in `.git/git-secure-key`, the file will be automatically
created on the initial invocation of `git-fast-export(1)`. Encryption of
file names is also being considered but would likely require a separate
deterministic encryption scheme or some kind of local database.

## Installation

To install run:

	$ go get github.com/nmeum/git-secure-export/cmd/...

If you want to use the remote helper also install the scripts from the
`contrib/` directory. Refer to `contrib/README.md` for more information
on these scripts.
